# TimeOut

Our project focuses on students who want to take a break, to relax, to breathe, to study, and to catch up. On large campuses it's sometimes 
hard to find a place where you can sit and have a break. This is why our project TimeOut encourages students to share the perfect locations with
each other. Users can log in and share spots where they have found peace and quiet. These spots can be marked as available and unavailable as students 
use them. Apart from helping you find a quiet spot, students can post general advice and words of encouragement in order to help each other get through
the day or through difficult situations.
